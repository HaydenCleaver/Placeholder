## Game Pages

1. We'll have 2-3 small interactive games for a user to play.  Likely a reaction-time clicking game where you click a box and it reappears elsewhere.  We'll also have some sort of word guessing game that utilizes an array of words that retrieves them for the user. 

2. Entertainment value for customers.  Fights off boredom, may help with reflexes and cognitive sharpness.

3. Interactive games would need to be in a playable state.  Links to both games and to the 'about us' page.


## Fitness Tracker

1. Enter and track workout dates on one page. Other pages may track food calories, burned calories, target heart rate, etc...

2. Addresses organization problems that customers may face when trying to maintain fitness and dietary regimens.  Helps people keep all of their data in one centralized location and assists them with calculations.

3. Entry forms and calculators would need to submit data.  Charts that reflect entries would also need to render to the site.
