            <p>Hello, my name is Hayden Cleaver. I was previously a military linguist for 6 years and since
                then I
                have been in school for a couple of years but I have decided to switch tracks and pursue
                opportunities in the tech industry. I chose software development in particular because I'm
                familiar
                with detailed analysis and dealing with new languages from my time in the military. I think
                that
                those skills have transferred pretty well so far into helping me adjust and learn how to
                code in an
                immersive training program. I also have pretty extensive experience with teamwork and
                professional
                correspondence and communication, and I would love to take those abilities and my training
                and apply
                what I've learned to contribute to a team as well as continue to develop my skills in this
                field.
            </p>

            <p>Hello, my name is Rexie Esmeralda! Had recently left the Navy after 6 years and shifted focus from being
                a Hydraulic Elevator technician to my insterests since I was a kid which is being a software developer.
                I started this journey not being able to do what I wanted in the Navy however, now that I have full
                control of my career I want to take this opportunity to fully focus on being a software developer. I
                think that my previous skills although not closley related has made this transition a whole lot easier
                by the amount of troubleshooting I have done previously in the Navy and how it relates to
                troubleshooting my code when I have stuff that don't work.

            <p>Hello, my name is Caelin Hargrave. I'm 29 and coming to you from Houston, Texas.
                I recently finished a 8 year commitment to the Navy where I served as an aviation electronics technician.
                Before joining the military I attended Texas Tech university to get a bachelor's degree in computer
                science.
                After a few years I decided to join the military for a break and to get my college paid for. Now I'm
                just
                trying to reach that same end goal on a way shorter time frame. My goal is to work in the WEB 3 space to make
                 new things that change the way we interact on the internet.
